## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### Reporting Process

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send a detailed report to our security team via private channels
3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested remediation (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours of report receipt
- **Triage**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity (Critical: 7 days, High: 14 days, Medium: 30 days)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and users have time to update

### Security Measures

This repository implements the following security controls:

#### Code Security
- **Static Analysis**: CodeQL, Bandit, Semgrep
- **Dependency Scanning**: Dependabot, Safety
- **Secret Scanning**: TruffleHog, GitHub Secret Scanning
- **License Compliance**: Automated license checking

#### Supply Chain Security
- **SLSA Level 3**: Cryptographically signed provenance
- **SBOM Generation**: Software Bill of Materials for all releases
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy vulnerability scanning
- **Signed Artifacts**: Cosign signatures on all build artifacts

#### Access Controls
- **Branch Protection**: Required reviews, status checks
- **CODEOWNERS**: Mandatory review by security team
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions for all workflows
- **OIDC Authentication**: No long-lived secrets

#### Monitoring
- **Security Alerts**: Automated alerts for new vulnerabilities
- **Compliance Monitoring**: SOC2 compliance tracking
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of all changes

### Security Best Practices

When contributing to this repository:

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate user inputs
2. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
3. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies up to date
4. **Secrets**: Never commit secrets or credentials
5. **Code Review**: All changes require security team review

### Threat Model

| Threat | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|---------|------------|
| Malicious code injection | Low | High | Code review, static analysis |
| Supply chain attack | Medium | High | SLSA provenance, dependency scanning |
| Secrets exposure | Low | Medium | Secret scanning, pre-commit hooks |
| Vulnerable dependencies | Medium | Medium | Automated dependency updates |

### Security Training

All contributors must complete:
- Secure coding training
- Supply chain security awareness
- Incident response procedures

### Compliance Standards

This project maintains compliance with:
- **SOC2 Type II**: Security, availability, confidentiality
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Risk management
- **OWASP ASVS**: Application security verification

### Security Tools Configuration

#### Required Scans
```yaml
# All PRs must pass these security checks:
- codeql-analysis
- dependency-review
- secret-scanning
- container-security-scan
- license-compliance
```

#### Alert Thresholds
- **Critical/High**: Block merge, immediate notification
- **Medium**: Warning, require acknowledgment
- **Low**: Informational, tracked but not blocking

### Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response** (0-1 hour)
   - Assess scope and impact
   - Contain the threat
   - Notify stakeholders

2. **Investigation** (1-24 hours)
   - Root cause analysis
   - Impact assessment
   - Evidence collection

3. **Remediation** (24-72 hours)
   - Deploy fixes
   - Verify resolution
   - Update security controls

4. **Post-Incident** (1 week)
   - Lessons learned
   - Process improvements
   - Documentation updates
